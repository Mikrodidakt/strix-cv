\section{experience}

\subsection{summary}

I graduated with a master in 2008. I have mostly worked with GNU/Linux on embedded systems. I have worked on my own and in groups, I have learned to take responsibility, plan and structure my work, I have learned how to take a project from start to finish. I work best when pushed and when people put their confidence in me and my possibility to grow and learn.
